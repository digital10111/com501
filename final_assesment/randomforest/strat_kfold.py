class StratifiedKFold2(_BaseKFold):
    """Stratified K-Folds cross-validator.

    Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets.

    This cross-validation object is a variation of KFold that returns
    stratified folds. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of
    samples for each class.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <stratified_k_fold>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``n_splits`` default value changed from 3 to 5.

    shuffle : bool, default=False
        Whether to shuffle each class's samples before splitting into batches.
        Note that the samples within each split will not be shuffled.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        When `shuffle` is True, `random_state` affects the ordering of the
        indices, which controls the randomness of each fold for each class.
        Otherwise, leave `random_state` as `None`.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
    >>> skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=2)
    >>> skf.get_n_splits(X, y)
    2
    >>> print(skf)
    StratifiedKFold(n_splits=2, random_state=None, shuffle=False)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in skf.split(X, y):
    ...     print("TRAIN:", train_index, "TEST:", test_index)
    ...     X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...     y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    TRAIN: [1 3] TEST: [0 2]
    TRAIN: [0 2] TEST: [1 3]

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is designed to:

    * Generate test sets such that all contain the same distribution of
      classes, or as close as possible.
    * Be invariant to class label: relabelling ``y = ["Happy", "Sad"]`` to
      ``y = [1, 0]`` should not change the indices generated.
    * Preserve order dependencies in the dataset ordering, when
      ``shuffle=False``: all samples from class k in some test set were
      contiguous in y, or separated in y by samples from classes other than k.
    * Generate test sets where the smallest and largest differ by at most one
      sample.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.22
        The previous implementation did not follow the last constraint.

        Parameters

        X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training data, where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.

            Note that providing ``y`` is sufficient to generate the splits and
            hence ``np.zeros(n_samples)`` may be used as a placeholder for
            ``X`` instead of actual training data.

        y : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
            The target variable for supervised learning problems.
            Stratification is done based on the y labels.

        groups : object
            Always ignored, exists for compatibility.

        Yields
        ------
        train : ndarray
            The training set indices for that split.

        test : ndarray
            The testing set indices for that split.

        Notes
        -----
        Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
        split. You can make the results identical by setting `random_state`
        to an integer.
