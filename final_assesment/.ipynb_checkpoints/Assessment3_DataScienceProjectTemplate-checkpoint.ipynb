    "BitsBank wants to catch suspicious credit card transactions for further fraud investigation. The bank decided to invest in a new system and tasked you with the mission of building a prediction model that is capable of detecting potential fraudulent transactions. Their budget for the system is £1million. The bank provided us with their historical transactions data. Each record constitutes a set of attributes for each transaction with a flag of either being normal or fraudulent. The original attributes have been passed through a PCA process that gave the set of features that we see in the dataset. This has been done for two reasons: firstly to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, and secondly to anonymise the information of their customers. Fraudulent cases constitute a small percentage of the overall transactions. [The dataset can be downloaded here](https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/xid-18675934_4).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each case that is nominated by your predictive model to be fraudulent and turns out to be not fraudulent costs the bank around £1k. Such cases harm the bank’s customer satisfaction ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each case that is not nominated by your predictive model to be fraudulent and turns out to be fraudulent costs the bank £10k on average. Such cases harm the bank’s reputation and costs them future customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Their main requirements are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. to catch at least 90% of actual fraudulent cases \n",
    "\n",
    "2. to ensure that at least 70% of the predicted cases for further investigation are actually fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the formal requirements, BitsBank have supplied more budgetary information that should guide development of the system. Each non-detected case of fraud costs the bank on average £10k and causes much more harm to their reputation and market share. On the other hand, incorrectly nominating a transaction as fraudulent costs the bank £1k. BitsBank has set aside budgets of £50k and £30k for these error types respectively. The classifiers developed should aim to keep the number of these errors to within the specified budgets. "
