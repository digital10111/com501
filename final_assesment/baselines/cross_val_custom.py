    """Evaluate a score by cross-validation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object implementing 'fit'
        The object to use to fit the data.

    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to fit. Can be for example a list, or an array.

    y : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs), \
            default=None
        The target variable to try to predict in the case of
        supervised learning.

    groups : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into
        train/test set. Only used in conjunction with a "Group" :term:`cv`
        instance (e.g., :class:`GroupKFold`).

    scoring : str or callable, default=None
        A str (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)`` which should return only
        a single value.

        Similar to :func:`cross_validate`
        but only a single metric is permitted.

        If `None`, the estimator's default scorer (if available) is used.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - `None`, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
        - int, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable that generates (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For `int`/`None` inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and `y` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used. These splitters are instantiated
        with `shuffle=False` so the splits will be the same across calls.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            `cv` default value if `None` changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of jobs to run in parallel. Training the estimator and computing
        the score are parallelized over the cross-validation splits.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        The verbosity level.

    fit_params : dict, default=None
        Parameters to pass to the fit method of the estimator.

    pre_dispatch : int or str, default='2*n_jobs'
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - ``None``, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A str, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'

    error_score : 'raise' or numeric, default=np.nan
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised.
        If a numeric value is given, FitFailedWarning is raised.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    Returns
    -------
    scores : ndarray of float of shape=(len(list(cv)),)
        Array of scores of the estimator for each run of the cross validation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn import datasets, linear_model
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
    >>> diabetes = datasets.load_diabetes()
    >>> X = diabetes.data[:150]
    >>> y = diabetes.target[:150]
    >>> lasso = linear_model.Lasso()
    >>> print(cross_val_score(lasso, X, y, cv=3))
    [0.33150734 0.08022311 0.03531764]
